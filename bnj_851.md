### Text
ὁ ἐπίκλην Ξυστήρ, σοφιστής, οὗ διήκουσε καὶ Μουσώνιος ὁ φιλόσοφος. γέγονε δὲ ἐπὶ Μάρκου τοῦ βασιλέως. .... πλὴν περὶ τὸν ἢ κ̄ χρόνον γενόμενος γράφει ταῦτα τὰ βιβλία τὰ γέμοντα θαυμάτων· Τέχνην ῥητορικήν, ἣν μετὰ χεῖρας ἔχουσιν ἅπαντες· Περὶ στάσεων βιβλίον ᾱ· Περὶ ἰδεῶν λόγου βιβλία β̄· Περὶ Κοίλης Συρίας β̄.

### Translation
Hermogenes of Tarsus, nicknamed the Rasp, a sophist whom Musonius the philosopher heard. He lived under the emperor Marcus. ... Except being about 18 or 20 he wrote these books full of marvels: The Art of Rhetoric, which all have in their hands; On Issues in one book; On Types of Styles in two books; On Coele Syria in two books.

### Commentary
This passage contains several bits of information about Hermogenes of Tarsus that do not appear in other surviving sources: his nickname Rasp, that the philosopher Musonius heard him (διήκουσε implies that he was a student of Hermogenes), and that Hermogenes wrote a history of Coele Syria. Musonius is presumably the Stoic who was a contemporary of Longinus in Athens (cf. Porphyrius, _Life of Plotinius_ 20; K. Von Fritz, ‛Musonius (17)’, _RE_ 16.1 (Stuttgart, 1933), col. 898 and @heath_1998, 51).

Coele Syria, a region disputed by the Seleukids and Ptolemies, corresponds roughly to the Dekapolis of the New Testament; Strabo 16.2.1-2 defines its boundaries and relation to the rest of Syria. Two works of this title are attested: this work and another by Theodoros of Gadara ([BNJ 850](http://doi.org/10.1163/1873-5363_bnj_a850)). Only the _Suda_ bears witness to Hermogenes’ history and its attribution has been questioned. @mueller_1849, 523 lists the other possible attributions. One is the earlier Hermogenes of Tarsus who appears in Suetonius, _Life of Domitian_ 10: ‘occidit item Hermogenem Tarsensem propter quasdam in historia figuras, librariis etiam, qui eam descripserat, cruci fixis’ (‘[Domitian] likewise killed Hermogenes of Tarsus because of certain sketches in his history; even the scribes who had copied it were crucified’). While we know nothing else of this earlier Hermogenes of Tarsus, the _Suda_’s propensity to confuse homonymous authors lends support; furthermore, given the activities of Flavians in Judaea, a work on Coele Syria may have included something offensive to them. Another possibility is the Hermogenes listed by Josephus among historians who spoke of the antiquity of the Jews (Josephus, _Against Apion_ 1.216; cf. [BNJ 737 F 1](http://doi.org/10.1163/1873-5363_bnj_a737)), although both Müller and T. Reinach (in his edition of _Contra Apionem_ (Paris 1930), 41) believed this to be a reference to the author of On Phrygia ([BNJ 795](http://doi.org/10.1163/1873-5363_bnj_a795)). Still, there is no compelling evidence to deny the authorship to the rhetorician since _On Coele Syria_ appears in a list of otherwise genuine works of his. While Hermogenes did not specificallly write a Τέχνη ῥητορική (‘Art of Rhetoric’), this seems to offer a collective title for his rhetorical treatises which then follow individually. Other sources, such as Philostratos, are entirely focused on Hermogenes as an orator and rhetorician; their omission of a historical work is not surprising. And other sophists, such as Theodoros of Gaza ([BNJ 850](http://doi.org/10.1163/1873-5363_bnj_a850)) and Metrophanes of Eucarpia ([BNJ 796](http://doi.org/10.1163/1873-5363_bnj_a796)) wrote historical works (see @heath_1998, 51 on these).

## Biographical Essay
Hermogenes of Tarsus lived c. AD 160-230. Philostratos, _Lives of the Sophists_ 2.7, our main source for his life, gives his place of birth as Tarsus and notes his earlier success as a sophist. When Hermogenes was around fifteen, Marcus Aurelius came to hear him declaim and praised him (presumably in AD 176; cf. Dio Cassius 71.1). But on reaching adulthood, Hermogenes ceased to declaim and suffered the ridicule of his fellow sophists. He lived to old age in relative obscurity.

Five works ascribed to him have survived: _On Types of Style_ (_On Types of Style_: see @wooten_1987, Περὶ τῶν στάσεων (_On Issues_: see @heath_1995; Περὶ εὑρέσεως (_On Invention_), Περὶ μεθόδου δεινότητος (_On the Method of Forcefulness_), and Προγυμνάσματα (a set of rhetorical exercises). The first two are genuine, while the rest are spurious. His rhetorical works enjoyed a long Nachleben and were widely used in the East throughout the Byzantine period and in the West during the Renaissance. Περὶ Κοίλης Συρίας (_On Coele Syria_) has not survived and its ascription to Hermogenes has been questioned. Since only the title survives, nothing can be said of its character.
