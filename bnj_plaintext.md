This is a pointer: see the [Biographical Essay](#Biographical-Essay) below. Note that the anchors can have no upper case and no spaces; replace them by hyphens. 

You may ask how the anchor is created. This is done "automatically" in the case of headers. In this example, the MD header is `# Biographical Essay`. This gets transformedinto an ID that acts as anchor. 

What if the anchor is not a header? In JO, many phrases are marked with an anchor, so commentary can link to it, using a pointer. Idealy, such phrases are identfied by CTS and CITe URNs. This solves the problem in one go. Where these are not available, the phrase is placed between `##` like so: `## Phrase that needs anchor ##`. This is an alternative way of writing a head, and so makes used of the magic described above. (The pointer is of course `#phrase-that-needs-anchor`.)

This is text in italics: *italics*.

This is text in bold: **bold**.

This is the Pandoc extension for superscript: ^superscript^. But we

This is the Pandoc extension for subscript: ~subscript~. But we don't

## Biographical Essay

### A Reappraisal
F. Jacoby’s treatment of Hippias (FGrHist I (Kommentar), 477-478) was
undeservedly brief, obviously due to his low assessment of Hippias’ role
in the development of Greek historiography.

### some other stuff
Stufff stufff stufff

## Bibliography

### Editions:
Alongside F. Jacoby’s *FGrHist* 6, standard editions of Hippias
(replacing the much outdated C. Müller’s *FHG* 2.59-63) are still:
